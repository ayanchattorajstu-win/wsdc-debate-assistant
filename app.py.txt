    DEBATE DETAILS:

    - My Speaker Role: {speaker_role}

    Your task is a two-part process:

    ### PART 1: ESTABLISH THE CASE FOUNDATION
    First, you must create the foundational elements of our case. This section should be detailed, well-explained, and principled, like in the V2 style.
    - **Detailed Definition:** Provide a strategic and nuanced definition of the key terms in the motion. Explain the reasoning behind your definition.
    - **Detailed Team Line / Counter-Stance:** Provide a comprehensive and memorable Team Line (for Prop) or Counter-Stance (for Opp). Explain the core philosophy it represents.

    ### PART 2: DRAFT THE SPEAKER-SPECIFIC SPEECH
    Now, using the foundation you just established in Part 1, draft a concise speech outline for the specified speaker role.
    - **Follow Role Responsibilities:** Adhere strictly to the specific responsibilities for a {speaker_role}. Be very crisp.
    - **Integrate the Foundation:** Your speech should clearly reflect the Definition and Team Line from Part 1.
    - **Use Evidence:** Incorporate concepts and quotes from the knowledge briefing.
    - **Structure Clearly:** Use markdown for headings and bullet points.

    SPECIFIC ROLE RESPONSIBILITIES:
    {role_instructions}

    Now, generate the complete output, starting with Part 1.
